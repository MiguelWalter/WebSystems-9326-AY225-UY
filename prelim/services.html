            <h2>Donor Recruitment and Retention</h2>
            <p>To meet the increasing demand for blood and augment the national blood requirement, the PRC conducts education and recruitment sessions to encourage regular voluntary blood donations from communities, different companies, organizations, colleges, and universities nationwide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h2>Blood Collection</h2>
            <p>With different PRC blood service facilities strategically located throughout the country, the PRC collects blood from voluntary, non-remunerated blood donors with their donations accounting for almost 50% of the nation’s blood supply.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h2>Blood Component Processing</h2>
            <p>Whole blood donations are separated into components using special equipment to generate one unit each of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Thus, one donation can help save three lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h2>Blood Storage and Issuance</h2>
            <p>Once blood is suitable for transfusion, it is stored in a temperature-controlled blood bank refrigerator. Clients or patients needing blood for transfusion may request it from any PRC blood facility upon presentation of a blood request form issued by a hospital or physician.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h2>Blood Samaritan Program</h2>
            <p>The Blood Samaritan Program is aimed mainly to assist indigent patients needing blood transfusions. The PRC seeks kind-hearted individuals/groups willing to give financial donations to support the blood needs of indigents. The donated money covers the payment of blood processing fees for legitimate indigent patients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="program">
            <h2>Blood Donor Recognition</h2>
            <p>We have instituted different awards to recognize and thank individuals and groups who tirelessly help us achieve our mission. Blood Galloner pins, certificates, medals, and plaques are some of the tokens we issue during the annual Blood Donors Recognition Ceremony held every July in celebration of Blood Donors Month.</p>
